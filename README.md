This program aims to determine academic performance in students based upon a variety of factors, using a dataset with 20 features and over 6,000 samples.
In order to do this, the program compares the accuracy of a KNN Classifier, a Logistic Regression model, and a dummy classifier so that we can choose
the best model for this evaluation.

Libraries needed to run the program are Pandas, Numpy, and Sklearn.
